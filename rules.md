# My Rules for my personal 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code or learn something programming related for at least an hour every day for at least 100 days.*

#### Start Date
March 29th, 2019.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day, using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time will only count towards the challenge, if it is something outside my regular job tasks.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress, provide a link to the code I wrote or resources I used so that others can see my progress.
1. If I have to miss a day, I will add 2 more days to the challenge.
1. I will strive to do something every day, but if it is not possible due to life & work, I will not consider this a failure.
1. I will mainly focus on real projects, but reading technical blogs & books counts as well. Same with time spent on Tech Meetups or writing about Tech.
