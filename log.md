# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Started on 2019-03-04

### Day 1: March 04, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Clone the log repo and first entry.
Research GraphQl subscriptions (see links below).
Research some advanced learning materials for our React beginner workshop and added them to our collection.
Those were mostly about state management.

**Thoughts:** 
While researching learning resources, I accidentally learned about some of the key differences between Redux and MobX.
Kind of productive first day, even though I did not write any "real" code.

### Day 2: March 05, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Read about the use cases for CSS grid versus CSS flex-box layouts.
Play with grid layouts in CSS Garden game.
Also an interesting article about how to learn, planning to try some of the tips for my next learning topics!

**Thoughts:** 
I am not convinced of the `order` property in grids yet. 
The description praises this as an advantage compared to table layouts, but it seems like it would be really confusing in a real app.
The counting of the columns / rows took a while: 
For the smaller value it starts at the value itself, but for the bigger value it only goes up to the grid cell before the value.
The negative values are still not clear, I never managed to find out what -1 should do. :-(
In general I like the CSS grid and would love to try it in a real app: 
I am planning now to do the layout my next project with only grid and flex-box.

### Day 3: March 06, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
I went to a meetup from @wtm_berlin about Mindfulness from an engineering perspective. 
That only counts partially, but on the other hand I could really use some ways to relax my mind.
Learned some fun facts about arithmetic operations in Javascript by trying the craziest combinations I could think of.
Continued to search learning materials for my react workshop.
Had some more project ideas for this challenge.

**Thoughts:** 
- Meditation is super hard when you are as tired as I am. Maybe I should try a standing meditation next time.
- Javascript is a very tolerant language. Which is nice, because there are so many types of errors you don't need to handle. But it can also lead to the nastiest bugs because you have no error message to start debugging.
- Also Javascripts approach to math is very "free spirited", to put it nicely. `null * 100 = 0` - why not :shrug
- React workshop is coming along nicely, I am just now wondering if we should include hooks. But maybe that is a nice project idea for after the workshop...
- I also need a good way to organise my ideas for this challenge. I have a list that is a wild mix of technologies and project ideas. Ideally I would find a way to organise and find good combinations.

### Day 4: March 07, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Reading again about GraphQL subscriptions, this time with Relay.
Played a bit with a CSS grid layout, mainly to answer some questions that popped up after the Grid Garden game.
Inspired by work, but outside of work: read about Java streams and also discussed programming language characteristics with my husband.

**Thoughts:** 
- I am getting a bit scared of these subscriptions, because I can not really graps the whole flow yet. Hope this will get better after I am working on a PoC.
- CSS grid is so neat. I already started thinking about it as a possible solution to some of the layout problems I was facing at work.
- Still I need to build a webpage with it to really internalize the concepts.
- I haven't worked with a strict OO language like Java in a while (about two years) and I can not get used to it again. Seems so tedious to define a class everytime I need to do anything. Why can't I just define a function when that is all I need? If the domain fits nicely to a OO model, I think I would still prefer something like Ruby where you have classes but can still do stuff outside of them. On the other hand being able to pass functions to functions is a feature I really love in a language... Javacript is not that bad after all :shrug
