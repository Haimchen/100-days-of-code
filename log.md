# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Started on 2019-03-04

### Day 1: March 04, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Clone the log repo and first entry.
Research GraphQl subscriptions (see links below).
Research some advanced learning materials for our React beginner workshop and added them to our collection.
Those were mostly about state management.

**Thoughts:** 
While researching learning resources, I accidentally learned about some of the key differences between Redux and MobX.
Kind of productive first day, even though I did not write any "real" code.
