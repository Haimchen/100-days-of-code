# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Started on 2019-03-04

### Day 1: March 04, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Clone the log repo and first entry.
Research GraphQl subscriptions (see links below).
Research some advanced learning materials for our React beginner workshop and added them to our collection.
Those were mostly about state management.

**Thoughts:** 
While researching learning resources, I accidentally learned about some of the key differences between Redux and MobX.
Kind of productive first day, even though I did not write any "real" code.

### Day 2: March 05, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Read about the use cases for CSS grid versus CSS flex-box layouts.
Play with grid layouts in CSS Garden game.
Also an interesting article about how to learn, planning to try some of the tips for my next learning topics!

**Thoughts:** 
I am not convinced of the `order` property in grids yet. 
The description praises this as an advantage compared to table layouts, but it seems like it would be really confusing in a real app.
The counting of the columns / rows took a while: 
For the smaller value it starts at the value itself, but for the bigger value it only goes up to the grid cell before the value.
The negative values are still not clear, I never managed to find out what -1 should do. :-(
In general I like the CSS grid and would love to try it in a real app: 
I am planning now to do the layout my next project with only grid and flex-box.
