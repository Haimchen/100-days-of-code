# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Started on 2019-03-29

### Day 1: March 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
I got to do something really different at work: Learned a lot about AWS Cloudformation and how to write templates.
Our WIP template can now create a stack with one app plus an environment created from a template.
After work I joined WWG Berlin to learn some more Go.
Wrote some code snippets to benchmark iterations over multi-dimensional arrays.

**Thoughts:**
I am eternally torn between wanting to do more backend focused work (and use Go) and Frontend.
Styling and all that is not my passion, but on the other hand almost any project idea I have needs a good frontend (while the backend can be quite minimal sometimes).
Also automating AWS is fun and would be not as hard as I thought. The major obastacle is the complexity of our deployment.
