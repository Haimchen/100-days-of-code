# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Started on 2019-03-29

### Day 1: March 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
I got to do something really different at work: Learned a lot about AWS Cloudformation and how to write templates.
Our WIP template can now create a stack with one app plus an environment created from a template.
After work I joined WWG Berlin to learn some more Go.
Wrote some code snippets to benchmark iterations over multi-dimensional arrays.

**Thoughts:**
I am eternally torn between wanting to do more backend focused work (and use Go) and Frontend.
Styling and all that is not my passion, but on the other hand almost any project idea I have needs a good frontend (while the backend can be quite minimal sometimes).
Also automating AWS is fun and would be not as hard as I thought. The major obastacle is the complexity of our deployment.

### Day 2: March 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Joined a WWG Berlin event with Bill Kennedy and learned a lot about the details of how slices work and where the dangers lay.
I also learned that there is a third optional parameter when slicing a slice.
It allows you to define the capacity of the new slice to override the default.
In the evening I also did some work with CSS, trying to override some styles from a Wordpress Theme.
I also wrote my version of the Challenge rules on the U-Bahn...


**Thoughts:**
Using my laptop on public transport is very inconvenient and probably bad for my back.
But I am very happy to have my own ruleset now, so I can work on this challenge and have a chance to finish.
And feel good about it and not guilty for "cheating" :-)
Also Go is awesome and Bill Kennedy a great teacher.
And CSS is just CSS. It is a real challenge to adjust a wordpress theme with minimal use of `!important`.
